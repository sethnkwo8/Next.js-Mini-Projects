    - No client-side auth checks or flicker
- 🧠 Server-first architecture
    - Zero client auth state
    - No localStorage, no useEffect guards
- 🧩 Clean project structure
    - Feature-based organization
    - Centralized auth logic

## 🔁 Authentication Flow
1.	User tries to access /dashboard
2.	Middleware checks for authToken cookie
3.	If missing → redirect to /login
4.	Login form submits to a Server Action
5.	Server sets HTTP-only cookie and redirects
6.	Middleware allows access to dashboard
7.	Logout clears cookie and redirects back to login

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
-	Why authentication should live on the server
-	How middleware prevents unauthorized rendering
-	When to use Server Actions vs API routes
-	How Next.js handles routing, caching, and redirects

---

## 📌 Notes
This project intentionally avoids:
-	Client-side auth state
-	localStorage
-	useEffect-based redirects

To demonstrate secure, production-ready patterns.
